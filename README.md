# planck-service
Smallest possible micro service - Combines compactness of portable machine code with the expressiveness of high level abstractions, and the power of mathematics.
## STATUS: EXPERIMENTAL
## The Idea
- Abandon the delusion that there is a *best* language/method/paradigm to develop software with.
- Embrace computation.
- Embrace data.
- Embrace bottom up.
- Put the few proven, well established and most powerful abstractions to work.
- Restrain your appetite for syntactic sugar.
